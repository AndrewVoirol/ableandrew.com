      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
      With over 20 years of experience in enterprise solutions, software architecture, and adventure tourism, I have developed a unique blend of technical skills and strategic thinking. My career began in collaborative architecture and graphic design, eventually leading me to establish a digital marketing and technology solutions agency in the hospitality sector. My adaptability and innovative mindset were further sharpened through diverse experiences, including managing IT solutions and crafting marketing strategies. Having faced personal challenges and ventured into adventure tourism, I have cultivated resilience and a deeper professional empathy. Currently, I am immersed in AI and machine learning, particularly in life sciences, and am eager to explore opportunities in AI engineering, product development, or leadership roles, where I can apply my diverse expertise and contribute to technological advancements.
